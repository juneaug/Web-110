            <h2>Modern Video Games</h2>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Music has become a huge part of modern video games, playing a big role in how we experience them. 
                Every triple A game (high budget video game by a major publisher) has a hired composer that delivers many incredible pieces of music.
                It is not just background noise anymore, the right song/track can totally change the mood of a game. 
                Think about games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Halo, where the music sets the overall futuristic vibe for everything. It adds on to the experience of 
                exploring a mysterious world or driving through a large dystopian city. Some games even have entire soundtracks that weren't composed but fans 
                love to listen to it either way outside of the game. Music in video games always helps tell the story by encouraging excitement during intense moments, and even brings 
                back memories of the first time you played. Just like in movies, the music in modern video games is something we can not 
                ignore since it is a huge part of what makes gaming so special. In 2023, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor won best original soundtrack at the Game Awards.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite original soundtracks are in order of ranking:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
                <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
                <li>Elden Ring</li>
                <li>The Witcher 3</li>
                <li>Minecraft</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Storytelling</h3>
            <p>Storytelling in my opinon has vastly improved as video games have advanced. Storytelling in modern video games has become incredibly 
                immersive and complex. Since budgets have increased, there is more time and resources that go into the craft of the video game experience. 
                It's not just about following a plotline, but about experiencing the story yourself. You quickly meet chracters, understand and empathize with their experiences and situation.
                 Many characters you will end up hating, loving, and even being suspicious of. Games like The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption 2 pull you in by making you care deeply about the characters 
                 and the choices they make. Unlike movies or books, video games let you influence the direction of the story, which makes the experience feel personal. Modern video games have the advantage of giving you 
                 the choice to completely change the story by making hard decisions. The narratives in games 
                 today are great and tackle deep themes, like loss and morality that will keep players' attention. Whether 
                 you're solving mysteries in a fantasy world or surviving a dystopian future, the way games tell stories have good emotional
                 engagement that rival other forms of media. It is like living the story.</p>
