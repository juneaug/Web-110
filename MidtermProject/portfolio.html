            <p>I'm a passionate and dedicated speedcuber with over 8 years of experience solving puzzles at 
                competitive events. My journey in cubing has been full of challenges and I've participated 
                in several speedcubing events. In addition to competing, I enjoy helping others 
                learn the methods and skills needed to solve the Rubik's Cube and other puzzles</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Since 2022, I began tutoring and helping new cubers that came to the Kansas tournments/events. 
                Over the years, I gained enough confidence and experience to help out other cubers and I found that
                it is something I am also passionate about. I gave advice on finger placement, new algorithms, and 
                confidence.</li><br>
            <li>I kept in touch with many of the people I helped through social media where I saw a lot progress 
                    in shortening their times.</li>
