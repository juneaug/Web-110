            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Adrian Nunez and for over 8 years I have been solving Rubik's cubes and all other sorts of puzzles. 
                    Solving puzzles has always been a passion for me ever since I received my first cube when i was 12 years old. The
                    Rubik's cube isn't the only puzzle available, there are in fact various types of puzzles ranging from a 2x2 cube to 
                    a Megaminx which is a 12 sided puzzle. </p>

            <p>After some time, I began to appreciate the problem solving aspect and strategy behind the cube. As I learned more 
                algorithms and practiced regularly, I found myself improving and gaining faster times. What started as my casual 
                 interest turned into a passion, there was something rewarding about continuously pushing my limits and seeing progress 
                 with every solve. This encouraged me to go to cubing tournaments which are held around the country and the world every year, many 
                 events are held in these tournaments where there are many challenges to face. The cubing community only gets larger every year 
                 as social media presents events, different puzzles, and videos to a new generation. Therefore, there is demand for even more tournaments, 
                 which as a result help make tournmanets in new places around the country. As a speecuber, I gained many important skills
                 over the years which have benefitted my solves.</p>

            <p><b>Skills and practices that experienced speed cubers have:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Algorithmic Memorization</li>
                <li>Rapid Recognition</li>
                <li>Focus</li>
                <li>Patience</li>
                <li>Well Calculated Finger Placements</li>
                <li>Scramble Reading</li>
                <li>Involvement in the community</li>
                <li>Cube customization</li>
                <li>Cube tools and enhancements such as clickers and lube</li>
                <li>Experience in various puzzles</li>

            </ol>

            <p>The way I learned how to improve was to practice through trial and error since many cubers make bad habits in the beginning of their speedcubing journey.
                 But the most important tool is your cube, specfically a speed cube. Because speedcubes are engineered to be solved faster, it is absolutely necessary
                 to own one. Youtube is the best source to learn information ranging from new algorithms, finger tricks, cube variation, to other important advice. This 
                 is how I learned how to solve cubes much faster.
